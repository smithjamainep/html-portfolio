<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello My Name is Jamaine P. Smith. Here is a little bit about myself. I was born in East St. Louis, Illinois to
  two beautiful parents Felix P. Smith and Yvonne Lannette Richardson. I have two siblings Darrius M. Smith and Mariah Marie
  Smith. I had a pretty interesting childhood riddled with tragic loss. My beautiful Mother passed away when I was 9 years old.
  Although this transpired I was determined to make my parents proud.</p>

<p>I joined the United States Marine Corps in 2007 gaining enough credits to graduate early. I remembered sitting in class wondering
  how I can be of service to my country. I left taking charge of my life. I served 4 years honorably meeting my beautiful wife Kylie J.
  Smith. We migrated back to Illinois where we had our 1st born Addison Jade SMith on 10/02/2007. I was able to follow my dreams gaining 
  a bachelors degree and having Alexander Jaden Smith 12/08/15 and Abraham Josiah Smith 09/03/17.</p>

<p>Currently I serve in Kingdom Refiners Ministries and work for the Illinois Department of Correction. I aspire to be
  an Illinois State Trooper.
